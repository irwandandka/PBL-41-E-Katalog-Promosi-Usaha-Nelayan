# 📱 Fishermen Business Promotion Catalog

## About the Project

**Fishermen Business Promotion Catalog** is a mobile application I developed using Flutter as part of my Project-Based Learning (PBL) coursework in late 2023. This app was created to help local fishermen promote their sea products through a simple and accessible digital catalog.

## 💡 Motivation

Many fishermen have great products but lack the means to promote them digitally to the public. This app aims to bridge that gap by providing a catalog where fishermen can showcase their goods and reach potential buyers more easily.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – Used to build the entire mobile application.
- **Socket.IO** – Integrated for real-time chat functionality between users and fishermen.

## 🛠️ Core Features

- 📦 **Product Catalog** – Displays a list of sea products provided by local fishermen.
- 🔍 **Product Detail View** – Users can view more detailed information about each product.
- 💬 **Chat with Fishermen** – Allows users to chat directly with fishermen via a real-time messaging feature (powered by Socket.IO) to ask questions or discuss transactions.

> ⚠️ Note: Transactions are not handled inside the app. Users can negotiate or make purchases outside the app through the chat feature.

## 🧩 Challenges & Learning

I built this app entirely by myself while learning Flutter for the first time. One of the biggest challenges was managing time between learning a new framework and actually building a working, useful app. Through this project, I learned a lot about mobile app architecture, state management, UI design, and real-time communication.

## 🎯 Current Status & Future Plans

The project is currently complete for its initial purpose, but I have plans to continue improving it:

- Redesign the UI for a more modern and intuitive experience
- Add user authentication (login/register)
- Implement product categories and search/filter functionality
- Improve chat experience with history and better UI

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project is more than just a college assignment. It's a real example of how technology can empower local communities — like fishermen — to adapt and grow in the digital era. I hope to continue developing solutions like this that combine learning with real-world impact.
